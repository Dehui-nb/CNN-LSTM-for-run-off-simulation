# CNN-LSTM-for-run-off-simulation
This repository contains the code for the paper Non-monotonic Benefits of Spatial Detail in Deep Learning for Large-Sample Runoff Prediction. It enables the training and evaluation of four models, including Attr-LSTM, RasterMean-LSTM, MID-CNN-LSTM and HIGH-CNN-LSTM  for rainfall-runoff simulations across 531 CAMELS watersheds.
